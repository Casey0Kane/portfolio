As a developer, I want to showcase my skills in html and CSS for potential jobs. I should be using all the resources I have and all the tools I have learned to create a great looking portfolio.

As the creator I need to display the projects I have completed with links to them. I also need to display what my interests are and some stuff about me. I need a link to my github and linkedin on the page so whoever is using it can follow me.

As a visitor, I want to be able to view the site on any device no matter what the screen size is. I want a navigation bar that I can use to get around the site, and a nice looking webpage with good information about the creator. I want the website to be as responsive and easy to use as possible.
